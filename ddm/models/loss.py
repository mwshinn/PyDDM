    """An abstract class for a function to assess goodness of fit.

    This is an abstract class for describing how well data fits a model.

    When subclasses are initialized, they will be initialized with the
    Sample object to which the model should be fit.  Because the data
    will not change but the model will change, this is specified with
    initialization.  

    The optional `required_conditions` argument limits the
    stratification of `sample` by conditions to only the conditions
    mentioned in `required_conditions`.  This decreases computation
    time by only solving the model for the condition names listed in
    `required_conditions`.  For example, a simple DDM with no drift
    and constant variaince would mean `required_conditions` is an
    empty list.

    The optional `method` argument can be "analytical", "numerical",
    "cn", "implicit", or "explicit".

    This will automatically parallelize if set_N_cpus() has been
    called.
