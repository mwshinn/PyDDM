Please report bugs to <https://github.com/mwshinn/pyddm/issues>.  This
includes any problems with the documentation.  PRs for bugs are
greatly appreciated.

Feature requests are currently not being accepted due to limited
resources.  If you implement a new feature in PyDDM, please do the
following before submitting a PR on Github:

- Make sure your code is clean and well commented
- If appropriate, update the official documentation in the docs/
  directory
- Ensure there are Paranoid Scientist verification conditions to your
  code
- Write unit tests and optionally integration tests for your new
  feature (runtests.sh)
- Ensure all existing tests pass (``runtests.sh`` returns without
  error)

For all other questions or comments, contact maxwell.shinn@yale.edu.
