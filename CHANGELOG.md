# Version 0.9.0

Released September 28, 2025

## New features

- Support for undecided trials

  In many experiments, if subjects do not respond within a fixed amount of time,
  the trial times out.  These "undecided trials" (also called "lapse trials",
  "no-gos", or "timeouts") can now be incorporated into the model's likelihood
  instead of being excluded.  This also provides more accurate model estimation
  when the duration of the simulation is short.
  
- Mixture models in the gddm interface

  Any arbitrary mixture model for contaminant RTs can be simulated and fit using
  the familiar "gddm" interface.
  
## Other

- Improved error messages
- Compatibility with the BADS optimizer for fitting models (differential
  evolution is still the default)
- Compatibility with Python 2.13 and 2.14

## Breaking changes

- Due to improved support for undecided trials, models which are simulated for a
  short duration and use the uniform distribution mixture model may give
  slightly different likelihood.  This is unlikely to impact scientific results,
  but the numerical values for the likelihood will be very slightly different.


# Version 0.8.1

Released June 22, 2024

## Bug fixes

- Full support for numpy 2.0

# Version 0.8.0

Released May 19, 2024

## New features

- New interface (the "gddm" function) for easier model specification

  PyDDM has a new recommended and default way of constructing models.
  Previously PyDDM used an object-oriented interface.  While this was flexible,
  in practice, it required a lot of code to make even very simple models.  Now,
  nearly all models can be specified very simply using the "gddm" function.  See
  documentation for more information.  (The object-oriented interface will
  always be a part of PyDDM, so backward compatibility is maintained.)

- Additional views for the model GUI

  Previously, the model GUI showed the probability densities for the response
  time.  Now it also can show the psychometric function, chronometric function,
  and the shape of the bound.

- Complete documentation rewrite

  All of the documentation has been rewritten to use the gddm() function.  It
  has also been modified to make it more accessible and easier to follow.
  
- Clearer interface for fitting models

  Supports scikit-learn--style "fit" interface for models is now included and
  recommended by default.

- Analytical solutions with variable starting position

  Models with variable starting positions will now be automatically solved
  analytically instead of numerically.


## Other

- Increased compatility for building C extensions on different compilers
- The `minval`/`maxval` arguments of Fittable objects are now the default first and
  second argument in the object-oriented interface
- Better compatibility of `model_gui_jupyter` in new environments
- The "Solution.resample" function is now known as "Solution.sample".

## Bug fixes

- The function plot_model_pdf was fixed (thanks Baptiste!)

# Version 0.7.0

Released July 2, 2023

## New features

- Stimulus coding, accuracy coding, or "anything else" coding

  Previously, the top boundary in PyDDM always represented correct responses,
  and the bottom represented error responses.  Now, either boundary can
  represent anything.  This is given during model creation by specifying the
  names of the boundaries, e.g., Model(..., choice_names=("left", "right"))

- Speedup for the analytical solver

  The analytical solver now runs about 50% faster.  This is due to increased
  caching and a change to the structure of Solution objects.

## Other

- Fixes to resizing the axes when plotting the model
- Compatibility with Python 3.11
- solve_all_conditions can now accept condition combinations (thanks Cove!)
- Added ICPointRatio, a relative biased starting position

## Bug fixes

- Samples of different lengths can now be compared
- Fixed Boundary condition in the core simulation code, slightly improving
  accuracy for a given dx and dt
- Fixed Google Colab online demo

## Breaking changes

- Loops which depended on the copy of the model in the Solution object may have
  to be changed.  (This is unlikely to impact most users.)


# Version 0.6.1

Released July 10, 2022

## Minor changes

- The new C solver is now automatically selected under a wider range of
  invocation methods
- Solution objects allow evaluating the pdf at a single RT without creating a
  Sample.

## Bug fixes

- The new C solver produced lower-accuracy results for leaky and unstable
  integration


# Version 0.6.0

Released July 3, 2022

## New features

- Performance improvement (~10x faster)

    The backward Euler method has been rewritten in C.  This gives a substantial
    (~10x) performance increase compared to the numpy-based implementation.  The
    analytical solver has also been rewritten in C, resulting in a more modest
    (~2x) performance improvement.  PyDDM will fall back to the numpy method if
    the C module is not availabe.

- Easily create new non-decision time overlays

    It is now possible to inherit from the OverlayNonDecision class - in
    practice, this makes it easier to define non-decision times which depend on
    a task condition and/or parameters.

- Better logging (thanks Cove!)

    PyDDM now uses the logging module, making it easier to disable warnings
    based on their urgency level.


## Other

- The hill-climbing optimizer now accepts seeded values (thanks Daniel!)
- Error handling now operates slightly differently, which should reduce the
  number of errors and warnings seen by users
- Model parameters can now be easily accessed using the Model.parameters()
  method

## Bug fixes

- The seed in Solution.resample() was ignored
- When conditions were specified as a list, solve_partial_conditions would
  generate an invalid Solution object

## Breaking changes

- PyDDM should now be imported using "import pyddm" instead of "import ddm".
  This is to bring it into compliance with standard Python naming conventions,
  and fix bugs with namespace conflicts on some computers.

# Version 0.5.2

Released October 10, 2021

## Major changes

- Allow strings and tuples as conditions

    Previously, task conditions could only be specified by a single number.
    Now, they can be specified by either a string or a tuple.  Strings make
    "flags" more readable.  Tuples make it easier to work with long and/or
    variable-length task conditions, e.g., for stimuli which change over time in
    a different way on each trial.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed the gamma distribution non-decision time

## Other

- Improved documentation and error messages
- Switched continuous integration platforms from Travis to Github Actions

# Version 0.5.1

Released December 4, 2020

## Minor changes

- Option to suppress output in differential evolution
- Option to drop undecided trials when converting a sample to a pandas dataframe

## Bug fixes

- Fixes a bug in which Solution.resample can sometimes give negative RTs under
  certain conditions
- Fixes a bug in likelihood-based fitting methods which produced incorrect
  results when fitting with undecided trials
- Fixes a bug in condition_combinations which made fitting very slow for Samples
  with many conditions

# Version 0.5.0

Released: September 15, 2020

## New features

- Jupyter notebook compatibility

    In addition to the classic model GUI, it is now possible to
    explore models interactively in Jupyter notebooks using the
    "ddm.plot.model_gui_jupyter" function.  With this change, PyDDM
    also now offers online interactive examples.

- Analytical solutions for arbitrary point source initial conditions (thanks Nathan!)

    Analytical solutions are now implemented for point source initial
    conditions at points other than x=0.  The analytical solver will
    automatically detect if you have specified a compatible model, and
    if so, it will solve it analytically instead of numerically.  This
    leads to speed boosts of several orders of magnitude for these
    models.

- Prescriptive warning messages

    When possible, warnings now give details of how to correct the
    model, for example, by decreasing dx or dt.

## Bug fixes

- Fix broken robust loss functions
- Example code no longer gives warning messages
- Fixed integer overflows on Windows
- Fixed underflow warning messages on model simulation for specific
  models (thanks Nathan!)

## Breaking changes

- The "get_model_parameters" function now does not return repeated
  parameters.  So, if two parameters in your model share the same
  Fittable object, meaning they are fit together, only one copy of
  this will be listed in calls to "get_model_parameters".
  Corresponding changes were made to "set_model_parameters".

# Version 0.4.0

Released: June 19, 2020

## New features

- Trial-wise trajectory support for Overlays

    Overlays are an important feature of the GDDM, but previously they
    were not supported on trial-wise trajectory simulations.  Now, it
    is possible to define the function "apply_trajectory" in the
    Overlay object if the overlay can be applied to a trajectory
    simulation.

- Details of model fits are preserved

    After running a model fit, it is useful to know the parameters of
    the fit, the objective function value, the methods used for the
    fit, etc.  This information is now easily-accessible from within
    fit models as a FitResult object, with clear documentation on how
    to use it.

- Performance enhancements for Crank-Nicolson and analytical solutions

    Moderate speedups for the Crank-Nicolson method, and a roughly one
    order of magnitude speedup for analytical solutions

- Samples can be exported

    Previously, it was possible to create a new Sample object from a
    pandas DataFrame. Now, it is also possible to do the reverse, i.e.
    convert an existing Sample object to a pandas DataFrame.

## Bug fixes

- Documentation links now refer to the stable version instead of the
  development version.
- Fixed bug when bounds collapse to zero
- Sample objects were internally inconsistent when imported through
  pandas

## Other

- New option to suppress diagnostic text (thanks Arkady!)
- LossRobustBIC and LossRobustLikelihood now provide shortcuts for
  uniform distribution overlays.
- Added a new implementation of biased reward for compatibility with
  fittable bounds (thanks Nathan!)
- get_model_loss function as a shortcut for finding the value of a
  given loss function for a given model
- New function to get list of model parameter names
- Function to compute mean decision time for samples
- More informative error messages

## Breaking changes

- The command-line argument "method" now has a different meaning, and
  will throw an error if used for the previous purpose.  This made
  terminology for "fitting_method" and "method" more consistent: now
  "fitting_method" refers to the optimization routine
  (e.g. differential evolution) whereas "method" refers to the
  numerical algorithm (e.g. backward Euler)
- The "returnEvolution" arguement is now called "return_evolution".

# Version 0.3.0

Released: October 20, 2019

## New features

- Increasing bounds

    Previously, PyDDM supported collapsing bounds, but bounds were
    required to be monotonically decreasing.  This restriction was
    lifted, allowing bounds to both increase and decrease over time
    according to any arbitrary function.
    
- Tracking decision variable evolution (thanks Stefan!)

    The evolution of the decision variable distribution may be tracked
    over time by passing a flag to the solver routine.

- Custom optimizers

    Previously, PyDDM required optimizers (e.g. differential evolution
    or the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm) to be hard-coded.  Now,
    these algorithms can be passed as arguments to the
    "fit_adjust_model" function.

- Improvements in the model GUI

    The model GUI now has nicer-looking plots, and is more transparent
    when errors occur in the model.  Additionally, it now supports
    plotting a model when a sample is not present.

## Bug fixes

- Under certain conditions, parallel simulations were computationally
  inefficient.
- ICPoint had invalid arguments for the get_IC function
- simulate_trial cut off when reaching the boundary, contrary to the
  function documentation

## Other

- The PyDDM cookbook now provides several simple examples of how to
  use PyDDM in a variety of situations.
- Particle simulations may now use either RK4 or Euler's method
- Several new model components were added
- Error messages were improved
