class Dependence(object): # TODO Base this on ABC
    """An abstract class describing how one variable depends on other variables.

    This is an abstract class which is inherrited by other abstract
    classes only, and has the highest level machinery for describing
    how one variable depends on others.  For example, an abstract
    class that inherits from Dependence might describe how the drift
    rate may change throughout the simulation depending on the value
    of x and t, and then this class would be inherited by a concrete
    class describing an implementation.  For example, the relationship
    between drift rate and x could be linear, exponential, etc., and
    each of these would be a subsubclass of Dependence.

    In order to subclass Dependence, you must set the (static) class
    variable `depname`, which gives an alpha-numeric string describing
    which variable could potentially depend on other variables.

    Each subsubclass of dependence must also define two (static) class
    variables.  First, it must define `name`, which is an
    alpha-numeric plus underscores name of what the algorithm is, and
    also `required_parameters`, a python list of names (strings) for
    the parameters that must be passed to this algorithm.  (This does
    not include globally-relevant variables like dt, it only includes
    variables relevant to a particular instance of the algorithm.)  An
    optional (static) class variable is `default_parameters`, which is
    a dictionary indexed by the parameter names from
    `required_parameters`.  Any parameters referenced here will be
    given a default value.

    Dependence will check to make sure all of the required parameters
    have been supplied, with the exception of those which have default
    versions.  It also provides other convenience and safety features,
    such as allowing tests for equality of derived algorithms and for
    ensuring extra parameters were not assigned.
